# Monte Carlo Checkers Bot

The program contains a bot to play [8x8 Polish checkers](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warcaby).
It uses [Monte Carlo Tree Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search) (MCTS) to find the best moves.

## Parallelisation

To maximize the number of simulations per move, the bot utilizes GPU threads to conduct multiple simulations simultaneously.
On an **RTX 2060**, this allows it to reach up to **3.2 million simulations per second** from the starting positionâ€”**20 times more than the CPU**.
